I'm the co-founder at [Peregrine](https://www.benrudolph.com). We are working to deploy thoughtful technology to solve hard problems in government.

If you've found yourself here, you might also write software. At Peregrine, we love writing high-quality, impactful code. We enable organizations to unlock insights from their data and empower their people to solve their most mission-critical problems.Â From fighting wildfires to building safer communities, Peregrine is dedicated to helping our customers do their best work.

As a team, we are service-oriented entrepreneurs who are motivated by solving hard, mission-critical challenges. We trust each other, help each other, and love diving into challenges together. We believe empathy, curiosity, integrity, and excellent execution are key to building impactful software.
