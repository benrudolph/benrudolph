### Engineering values
Coding is a craft, and we hold ourselves to a high standard. These are a few of the values we hold that help us achieve that standard.

**üßº Leave it better**

An engineer leaves the code and abstractions better than how she saw them. The codebase is a collective responsibility; its success depends on the thoughtful, consistent actions from everyone.

**üèî Rise to the challenge**

We are solving difficult technical problems that do not have clear or easy answers. An engineer understands this and embraces the unknown. They move mountains to accomplish awesome outcomes.

**üìì Seek first to understand**

An engineer first attempts to understand the person, the problem, and the situation before she considers a solution. She asks questions, speaks to customers, and invites feedback from the team. Listening closely and actively often reveals innovative solutions to nuanced problems.

**üé≥ Resilient teams**

Each person has a responsibility to ensure the team is successful, and the team supports each person in their journey. By focusing on the team, we are more effective in reaching business goals.

**‚ôª Feedback is a gift**

Feedback, both positive and constructive, is an essential mechanism for the health and growth of our team. An engineer seeks out feedback from their peers and offers thoughtful, constructive feedback to their teammates.
